Hub board on FT4232.

In September, 2012, I was looking for a tool to work with a variety of interfaces (UART, SPI, JTAG, etc). 
As a result, I developed a board on FT4232. Why I choose this chip? I had one, and he gives four interface ports.

Schematic and board in DesighSpark PCB, and copies of copper and mask in gerber.
And some pictures :)
